# 🎓 Student Pass/Fail Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** using Machine Learning.

The model is trained using student data such as:
- Study Hours per Day
- Attendance Percentage
- Previous Marks

Based on these inputs, the model predicts the final result.
